# Chess++
An implementation of standard Chess in C++ using SFML.

## About
Chess++ was my final project for CSCI 261 Programming Concepts at Colorado School of Mines during
the Summer II Semester of 2016.

Chess++ allows two players to play a standard Chess game against one another on the computer.
Gameplay follows standard Chess rules. At the start of the game, the user will have the option to
load a starting position via a Portable Game Notation (PGN) file. At the end of the game, the user
will have the option to save the game to a Portable Game Notation (PGN) file.
